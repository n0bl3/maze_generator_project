# Maze generator project README file

## Description
Maze generator is intended to be a cross-platform library written in C++ with boost and stl. The frontend is written in Qt. Library is intended to be independent from the frontend in all ways.
The project is for educational purposes only.

## How to build
1. Make sure QtCreator is installed on your system.
2. Make sure you have boost library development files installed on your system.
3. Open maze_generator_project.pro file in QtCreator.
4. Run 'Build All'.

## How to run
You may either hit 'Run' from QtCreator or run the executable from console/your favourite file manager.

## Cross-platform issues
As this is a simple educational project I didn't test it on any platform except for the Ubuntu 11.10, which is my default OS.

## Licence
You may use and distribute the sources as you wish.
